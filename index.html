    <h1>My last message for you, my greatest love.</h1>
    <p>
     Hello, Kyla :) This is my last message for you. Medjo mahaba kaya 'di nasusubmit sa sendthesong so, I made a website nalang po hehe.

Firstly, hearing that Anaheim made u think of me—it's bittersweet. Knowing I was once someone u could dedicate a song like that warms my heart, even if the message behind it stings a little. Thank u po for remembering bumati sa'kin^-^ Anw, I'm glad na u were finally able to let me go—or maybe I'm just glad to know ure happy even without me anm. Knowing you've found peace, or someone who makes u feel safe and loved, makes me happy for u ;)) even if it's no longer my role to be that person. I hope u continue to grow (idk lng sa height dejoke) and find more reasons to smile hehe stay strong po sainyo ng babi mo!<br><br>

      I can admit now that I was complicated in ways I didn't even understand back then. But, as I reflect, I realize that the only way I'll truly be able to move on is by facing these feelings, not running from them (so, I'm sorry po for hurting u with words I didn't even mean back then).<br><br>

      As much as I hope na there will be no hard feelings between us—ik u have every reason and right to still hate me. Ik u don't wanna see me anm but yk I don't want u to feel like u need to change schools just to adjust for me—idk or maybe I'm just holding on to the thought of seeing u, the last connection we have left idk basta whatever path u choose, I only wish for ur happiness & peace. You deserve that. So yea I hope yk I'll always treasure the memories we had, even if they're in the past now. No matter how things turned out, I'm glad we shared smth special, something worth remembering.<br><br>

      Dyk? Last time nung nag Little Haus kami, may card dun na nagtanong "what's the last big risk u did?" Smth like that. I answered "tending to my ex-partner's needs despite knowing the possible outcome of what we'd do." It's ewan to say haha but after saying that tsaka ko lang narealize mali wording ko, I didn't mean it in a way of blaming u. I felt guilty. Ever since we ended our rs, I never blamed u for anything that happened—even as a rant to anybody. Kasi alam ko na rs aren't about pointing fingers or keeping score. Ik what we had was real, and even if it didn't work out, ik both of us tried in our own ways. I've always believed na what we did was what we thought was best at that time haha puppy love nga naman oh*-* I only hope the same for u, sana hindi mo naisip or iniisip na ure not worth the risks I made. Because u were. You are. You've always been worth it, nd u deserve nothing less than the best, both love and in life ;))<br><br>

      Thank u for everything hmm? Thank u for the love u gave so freely, for the lessons u unknowingly taught me, nd for the moments that made me feel truly alive. You showed me what it means to care deeply for someone, to give and risk w/o hesitation. Even if it didn't last, what we had mattered, and it'll always hold a special place in my heart. Ig this is finally where I fully let you go. But letting go doesn’t mean forgetting. I'll always wish u happiness, success, and peace, even from afar ;) thank u for being part of my life, even if our paths no longer cross.<br><br>

      Advanced happy new year nadin and many more po hehe goodbye, and take care always, liit.
